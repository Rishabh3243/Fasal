                    <h4><b> About Bananas </b></h4>
                    <p>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit botanically a berry produced by several kinds of
                        large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa In some countries, bananas used for
                        cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is
                        variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich
                        in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The
                        fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless
                        (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The
                        scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa
                        paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic
                        constitution. The old scientific name for this hybrid, Musa sapientum, is no longer used.<br>

                        Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first
                        domesticated in Papua New Guinea.They are grown in 135 countries,primarily for their
                        fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine, and banana beer and as ornamental
                        plants. The world's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together
                        accounted for approximately 38% of total production.<br>

                        Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between "bananas" and "plantains". Especially in the
                        Americas and Europe, "banana" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those
                        of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast,
                        Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called "plantains". In other regions, such as
                        Southeast Asia, many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not
                        as useful and is not made in local languages.<br>

                            <h3>Type of soil require</h3>
                            Soil for banana should have good drainage, adequate fertility and moisture. Deep, rich loamy
                            soil with pH between 6-7.5 are most preferred for banana cultivation. Ill drained, poorly
                            aerated and nutritionally deficient soils are not suitable for banana. Saline solid,
                            calcareous soil are not suitable for Banana cultivation. Avoided soil of low laying areas,
                            very sandy & heavy black cotton with ill drainage.<br>

                            A soil that is not too acidic & not too alkaline, rich in organic material with high
                            nitrogen content, adequate phosphorus level and plenty of potash are good for banana.

                            <h3>Climate</h3>
                            Banana is basically a tropical crop, grows well in temperature range of 13ºC – 38ºC with RH
                            regime of 75-85%. In India this crop is being cultivated in climate ranging from humid
                            tropical to dry mild subtropics through selection of appropriate varieties like Grandnaine.
                            Chilling injury occurs at temperatures below 12ºC. The normal growth of the banana begins at
                            18ºC, reaches optimum at 27ºC, then declines and comes to a halt at 38ºC. Higher temperature
                            causes sun scorching. High velocity wind which exceeds 80 km phrs damages the crop.

                            <h3>Irrigation</h3>

                            Banana, a water loving plant, requires a large quantity of water for maximum productivity.
                            But Banana roots are poor withdrawal of water. Therefore under Indian condition banana
                            production should be supported by an efficient irrigation system like drip irrigation.

                            Water requirement of banana has been worked out to be 2000mm per Annum. Application of drip
                            irrigation and mulching technology has reported improved water use efficiency. There is
                            saving of 56% of water and increasing yield by 23-32% under drip.

                            Irrigate the plants immediately after planting. Apply sufficient water and maintain field
                            capacity. Excess irrigation will lead to root zone congestion due to removal of air from
                            soil pores, thereby affecting plant establishment and growth. And hence drip method is must
                            for proper water management in Banana

                            <h3>Manuring & Fertilization</h3>
                            Banana requires high amount of nutrients, which are often supplied only in part by the soil.
                            Nutrient requirement has been worked out on all India basis is to be 20 kg FYM, 200gm N;
                            60-70gm P; 300gm K/plant. Banana requires heavy nutrition. Banana crop requires 7-8 Kg N,
                            0.7- 1.5 Kg P and 17-20 Kg K per metric tonne yield. Banana responds well to application of
                            nutrients. Traditionally farmers use more of urea and less of phosphorous and potash.
                            In order to avoid loss of nutrients from conventional fertilizers i.e. loss of N through
                            leaching, volatilization, evaporation and loss of P and K by fixation in the soil,
                            application of water soluble or liquid fertilizers through drip irrigation (fertigation) is
                            encouraged. A 25-30% increase in yield is observed using fertigation. Moreover, it saves
                            labour and time and the distribution of nutrients is uniform.
