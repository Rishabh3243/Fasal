                    <h4><b> About Apple</b></h4>
                    <p>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are
                        cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree
                        originated
                        in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have
                        been
                        grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European
                        colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including
                        Norse,
                        Greek, and European Christian tradition.<br>

                        Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant
                        fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by
                        clonal
                        grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower
                        to
                        fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the
                        resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.<br>

                        There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various
                        tastes
                        and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a
                        number
                        of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and
                        non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease
                        control
                        and selective breeding in apple production.<br>

                        Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly
                        half
                        of the total</p>

                            <h3>Type of soil require</h3>
                            Apples grow best on a well-drained, loam soils having a depth of 45 cm and a pH
                            range of pH 5.5-6.5. The soil should be free from hard substrata and water-logged
                            conditions. Soils with heavy clay or compact subsoil are to be avoided.

                            <h3>Climate</h3>

                            The apple is a temperate fruit crop. However, in India the apple growing areas do
                            not fall in temperate zone but the prevailing temperate climate of the region is due
                            to the Himalayan ranges and high altitudes. The average summer temperature should be
                            around 21-24oC during active growth period. Apple succeeds best in regions where the
                            trees experience uninterrupted rest in winter and abundant sunshine for good colour
                            development. It can be grown at an altitude of 1500- 2700 m above the sea level.
                            Well-distributed rainfall of 1000-1250 mm throughout the growing season is most
                            favourable for optimum growth and fruitfulness of apple trees

                            <h3>Irrigation</h3>


                            Apple trees are particularly sensitive to low soil moisture. Water stress during the growing
                            season reduces number and size of fruits, and increases June drop. Success of apple largely
                            depends on uniform distribution of rain during the year in case of dry spells during the
                            critical periods supplementary irrigation should be provided. Water stress conditions
                            results in poor fruit set, heavy fruit drop, low production and poor quality. The most
                            critical periods of water requirement are April- August and peak water requirement is after
                            fruit set. Normally the orchards are irrigated immediately after manuring in the month of
                            December-January. During the summer periods, the crop is irrigated at an interval of 7-10
                            days. After the fruit setting stage the crop is irrigated at weekly intervals. Application
                            of water during the fortnight preceding harvest markedly improves the fruit colour.
                            Thereafter till the onset of dormancy, irrigation is given at an interval of 3-4 weeks

                            <h3>Manuring & Fertilization</h3>
                            Farmyard manure @ 10 kg./ year age of tree is applied along with other fertilizers. The
                            fertilizer dose depends upon the fertility of soil and amount of organic manure applied to
                            the crop. Generally, application of 350 g N, 175 g P2O5 and 350 g K2O per plant per year in
                            split doses is recommended for fully-grown bearing trees. On some trees deficiency of zinc,
                            boron, manganese and calcium may be observed which is corrected with the application of
                            appropriate chemicals through foliage spray.
