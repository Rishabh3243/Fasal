                    <h4><b> About Strawberries</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid
                        species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated
                        worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright
                        red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in
                        such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial
                        strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip
                        gloss, perfume, and many others.<br>

                        The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria
                        virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by
                        Amédée-François Frézier in 1714. Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in
                        commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry
                        species cultivated in the early 17th century.<br>

                        The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry. Technically, it is an aggregate
                        accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from
                        the receptacle that holds the ovaries.Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside of the
                        fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.<br>

                        In 2019, world production of strawberries was 9 million tonnes, led by China with 40% of the
                        total.<br>

                            <h3>Type of soil require</h3>
                            Strawberry has a fibrous root system. Hence majority of its roots remain in the top soil
                            penetrating maximum to a depth of 15 cm. Hence, it requires a humus-rich soil for
                            cultivation. It should be taken care that strawberry is not grown on soil that was
                            previously used for tomato, potato, raspberry, pepper or eggplant cultivation since these
                            are highly nutrient extracting plants. They drain the soil of their nutrients.

                            <h3>Climate</h3>
                            Strawberry needs a temperate climate for cultivation although some of the varieties can grow
                            in subtropical climate. They are short day plants. During flower formation, they need a
                            photoperiod (sunlight) of eight to twelve hours for about ten days. They are dormant and do
                            not grow during winters. Winter is followed by spring when the days grow longer. Therefore,
                            the plants get sunlight initiating flower development. However, in case of varieties grown
                            in sub-tropical regions wherein winters are mild the plants continue to grow. Strawberries
                            are classified into two groups on the basis of their response to the length of photoperiod
                            as:

                            Overbearing Varieties– They develop flower buds during long as well as short light periods.
                            Commercial Varieties– They flower only during the short light periods.

                            <h3>Irrigation</h3>
                            Drip irrigation is used in strawberry cultivation. In the drip system, 1- 2 lateral lines of
                            16 mm, with dripper at every 30 cm and having the discharge of 2 or 4 liter/hour.

                            Maintaining optimum soil moisture level is necessary as Strawberry is a relatively
                            shallow-rooted plant and highly susceptible to drought.

                            <h3>Manuring & Fertilization</h3>
                            Nitrogen has to be applied in two doses during March and October. However Farm yard manure,
                            Phosphorous and Potash are to be applied in October.

                            Fertilizers are applied in a circular band at a radial distance of 120 cm from the tree
                            trunk region. Deep placement or application of fertilizers at two to three areas in a basin
                            should be avoided. In fact, the maximum activity in sweet orange plantation was found within
                            a depth of 25 cm and in acid lime they are more surface oriented, 80-95% being located in
                            top 10cm.<br>
